My name is Ahmad Hossein Yazdani (Also known as Ahmadhossein Yazdani). I got my bachelor in computer software engineering from Univeristy of Tehran Iran in 2020. Currently, I'm doing my PhD at Virginia Tech. University in Blacksburg, VA, US since August 2020 in computer science under supervision of Dr. Ali Butt at Distributed System and Storage Lab. I have also experienced doing intern at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, supervised by Feiyi Wang, Sarp Oral, Ahmad Maroof Karimi and Arnab Kamur Paul.

I'm interested in distributed systems optimization, resource management, cloud computing and high-performance computing (HPC). My current research is on optimizing distributed systems for running various aspects of Machine Learning including training deep neural networks, federated learning, boosting GPU scheduling algorithms to fit ML workloads. On the other hand, I research on how to analytically improve the I/O performance of HPC workloads, or to reduce I/O contention in other words. I'm also enthusiastic on learning and researching about cloud computing.
