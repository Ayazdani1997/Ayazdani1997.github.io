      description:
        - Contributing to Metis project ongoing which is about improving the cachability of the deep learning workloads
        - Leading a collaborative research with Analytics & AI Methods at Scale Group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on analytically recognizing the behavior of the users and jobs submitted to HPC systems to improve the I/O efficiency of the HPC systems. We have recently started collaborating with Suren Byna and Jean Luca Bez from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). The work has been kicked off since the time I interned at ORNL in summer 2021

      institution: Oak Ridge National Laboratory
      year: 2021
      description:
        - Supervised by Feiyi Wang, Sarp Oral, Ahmad Maroof Karimi and Arnab Kamur Paul
        - First studied the literature on I/O characterization at application level to get insights for building an application and user aware I/O scheduler
        - Then collected I/O information of different users and different applications, and showed the userâ€™s behaviour affects the I/O performance quite a lot
        - And finally, presented my work at Internship Symposium held for the interns joined the national lab in summer 2021
