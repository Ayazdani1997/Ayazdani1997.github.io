      description:
        - Contributing to Metis project ongoing which is about improving the cachability of the deep learning workloads
        - Leading collaborative research with Analytics & AI Methods at Scale Group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on analytically recognizing the behavior of the users and jobs submitted to HPC systems to improve the I/O efficiency of the HPC systems. We have recently started collaborating with Suren Byna and Jean Luca Bez from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). The work has been kicked off since the time I interned at ORNL in summer 2021
        - Leading a collaborative research with Analytics & AI Methods at Scale Group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory aiming to address the I/O interference between the training/inference jobs for large AI models in HPC in collaboration with Jean Luca Bez, Ahmad Maroof Karimi, Arnab Kumar Paul, Suren Byna and Feiyi Wang
    - title: Student Assistant at NERSC, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), internship
      institution: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)
      year: 2024
      description:
        - I investigated the causes of I/O hotspots in HPC applications and analyzed common performance issues. Specifically, I examined Drishti, an HPC I/O recommendation tool, and found it generates many false positive warnings. In future work, I plan to address these inaccuracies, enhance Drishti's ability to provide more reliable I/O optimization recommendations, and improve its capacity to predict job performance based on suggested configurations.

      description:
        - Pursuing my research on I/O variance characterization in HPC systems under the supervision of Suren Byna and Jean Luca Bez.
    - title: Instructor
      institution: Virginia Tech
      year: 2022 - 2023
      description:
        - Teaching CS3214, Computer Systems, at Virginia Tech in Fall 2022 and Spring 2023
    - title: Internship at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Analytics & AI Methods at Scale Group.
      institution: Oak Ridge National Laboratory
      year: 2021
      description:
        - Supervised by Feiyi Wang, Sarp Oral, Ahmad Maroof Karimi and Arnab Kamur Paul
        - First studied the literature on I/O characterization at the application level to get insights for building an application and user-aware I/O scheduler
        - Then collected I/O information of different users and different applications, and showed the userâ€™s behavior affects the I/O performance quite a lot
        - And finally, presented my work at the Internship Symposium held for the interns who joined the national lab in the summer 2021
